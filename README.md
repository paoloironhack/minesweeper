# Minesweeper 1.0
Created by Victor Hugo AIZPURUA

The aim of MineSweeper is to determine the locations of 10 bombs, randomly placed in a 10x10 grid.

On each go, you type in the coordinates of a square, e.g. E4.

If there is a bomb in that square, you lose. Otherwise, a number representing the number of bombs directly surrounding that square will appear.

If that number is a 0, the squares around it will be 'opened' automatically, as there cannot be any bombs there.

If you think you know the position of a bomb, type 'M' followed by the coordinates of that square, e.g. ME4 and a flag 'marker' will appear.

You win by 'opening' all of the squares except those with bombs in.

Good luck!
